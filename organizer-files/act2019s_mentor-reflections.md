# Reflections by mentors on ACT2019

## David
I had a lot of fun with my group (autopoiesis). I think it might have been good to be forced into a bit more interaction with other groups. I think it was Eliana who suggested that instead of group presentations every day, we could form groups of six—one student from each group—and have each member explain to the others what they learned that day. That’s just one possibility of course for how more influential interactions could have taken place; I think the presentation format is not the best for real learning/information transfer.


## Bartosz (profunctor optics):
This was a wonderful and very intense experience. We spent hours analyzing papers, proving theorems, deriving formulas, discussing generalizations. Time was flying so quickly. I enjoyed the opportunity to interact with so many smart people with vast knowledge. I had fun interacting with the autopoiesis group, during lunches and at the pub, as their problems were more of a philosophical nature. There was also quite a bit of interest in lenses, so I was happy to spread the word.

- I might have been useful for me as an instructor to have
some guidelines on how to proceed initially or some
suggestions for how to organize things within the group.

- The level of the students is quite heterogeneous, and that
makes it challenging to collaborate on a research
project. In contrast to my other collaborations, this type
of collaboration feels more rigid and less fluid, in that
collaborators cannot easily be added or removed.  Similar
comments apply to the choice of topic: by now I have a topic
that would have been more suitable than my actual one.

- The school is a very nice way to tap the potential of
bright and motivated students, before they get selected by
other people and sucked into other areas.

- Given the many delays, I feel that 6 groups in total may
have been a bit too much.


## Hector:
Sadly my health wasn’t up to the full two weeks but I had a great time. As a TA I would have appreciated a summary of what was going to be expected of me well in advance of being asked to agree to it. The online sessions worked well, and I cannot stress how much more accessible it makes academia to have online sessions available. Sadly I can’t really comment on the in-person week presentations as I had to miss most of them. I think my group appreciated having both a teacher and a TA to help proof-read blog posts, fix latex issues and so on.
