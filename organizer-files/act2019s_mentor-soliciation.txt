Hi David,

This is Daniel Cicala.  I'm currently organizing the second iteration
of the Applied Category Theory (ACT) workshop/school.  I'm writing to
see if you'd be interested in being a mentor for the school. Mind, I'm
not seeking commitments or offering any certainties at this point. I'm
only writing to gauge your interest. Personally, I think you'd be a really
great addition.

I know you were at the workshop part of the ACT2018, and so maybe got
some of the flavor about what the school portion is all about.  But
just to provide some extra details...essentially, you would pick out a
project that you're interested in working on. Honestly, you have so
many interesting ideas and projects that would be a great fit. Your
categorical informatics would be exciting, or your work on
interconnected systems or distributed systems. But really it's fully
up to you what project to bring to the table.

You'd be paired with about 4 grad students split into two pairs.
You'd assign to each pair a reading that you think is requisite
background for your project.  They'd present their paper to the entire
group of students via video conference and write a blog post on the
paper for the nCat Cafe. The most fun part will happen in the summer
of 2019 (exact dates to be determined).  Everyone involved will get
together in Oxford and you'll have the full week to work on your
projects together with your students.

The link to last years ACT webpage is here http://www.appliedcategorytheory.org/school/. The mentors
then were:

John Baez, baez@math.ucr.edu
Pawel Sobocinski, ps@ecs.soton.ac.uk
Martha Lewis, marthaflinderslewis@gmail.com
Aleks Kissinger, aleks0@gmail.com

If you have any further question, please feel free to ask me or one of
last years mentors. I look forward to hearing from you.

Best
Daniel Cicala

Hi Tobias,

see if you'd be interested in being a mentor for the school. Mind, I'm
not seeking commitments or offering any certainties at this point. I'm
only writing to gauge your interest.

Essentially, this would consist of you picking out a project that
you're interested in working on that is applying category theory to
some non-pure math field. Based on your work and ideas, you would really be a
great fit. In particular, your work on information theory and resource
theory stands out as fitting well with what we are trying to do, but
really the project is completely yours to choose.

You'd be paired with about 4 grad students split into two pairs.
You'd assign to each pair a reading that you think is requisite
background for your project.  They'd present their paper to the entire
group of students via video conference and write a blog post on the

Hi Bartosz,

My name is Daniel Cicala, a student of John Baez.  I'm currently
organizing the second iteration of the Applied Category Theory (ACT)
workshop/school. The first year went very well and received interest
from many great people.  I'm writing to see if you'd be interested in
being a mentor for the school. Mind, I'm not seeking commitments or
offering and certainties at this time. I'm only writing to gauge your
interest. I think you'd be a really great addition.

How the school works is, essentially, you would pick out a project
that you're interested in working on that applies category theory to
some non-pure math field. Your work connecting functional programming
and category theory would fit in perfectly.  However, the project
you'd bring to the table is fully your decision.

You'd be paired with about 4 grad students split into two pairs.
You'd assign to each pair a reading that you think is requisite
background for your project.  They'd present their paper to the entire
group of students via video conference and write a blog post on the
paper for the nCat Cafe, a popular blog on category theory. The most
fun part will happen in the summer of 2019 (exact dates to be
determined).  Everyone involved will get together in Oxford and you'll
have the full week to work on your projects together with your
students.

project that you're interested in working on that applies category

interest, and what I think would be a great fit for the ACT school is
your work on rewriting theory and process calculii.  If you have a
project in these areas that you'd like some collaborators on, this
could be a great opportunity.  Even though I mention rewriting and the
process calculii, the project you bring to the table is fully up to you.

You'd be paired with about 4 grad students split into two pairs.

Hi Gordon,

gauge your interest.  You'd definitely be a excellent addition.

How the school works is, essentially, you would pick out a project
that you're interested in working on that applies category theory to
some non-pure math field. In fact, the ideas contained in your papers
'A calculus of chemical systems', 'Quantitative algebraic reasoning',
and 'Handling algebraic effects' are representative of projects we'd
like to include in ACT.  Ultimately, the project is fully your
decision and can consist of whatever your latest interests are.

You'd be paired with about 4 grad students split into two pairs.
You'd assign to each pair a reading that you think is requisite
background for your project.  They'd present their paper to the entire

Hi Pieter,

This is Daniel Cicala, Rick's former student.  I'm currently organizing
the second iteration of the Applied Category Theory (ACT)
workshop/school. The first year went very well and received interest
from many great people.  I'm writing to see if you'd be interested in
being a mentor for the 2019 school. Mind, I'm not seeking commitments

your interest. Personally, I think you'd be a really great addition.

How the school works is, essentially, you would pick out a project
that you're interested in working on that applies category theory to
some non-pure math field. What caught my interest is your work on
Turing categories and computability. Also, I recall while I was at
uOttawa, you were working with, I think, the Management and Psychology
faculties around strategies in one of Conway's games.  I don't know
what became of that project, but ideas like this are exactly what we
hope to bring into the ACT school. Ultimately though, what project
you'd like to bring to the table is fully your decision.

You'd be paired with about 4 grad students split into two pairs.
You'd assign to each pair a reading that you think is requisite
background for your project.  They'd present their paper to the entire

Hi Michael,

This is Daniel Cicala. We met in Leiden at last years Applied Category
Theory workshop. I'm currently organizing the second iteration of the
Applied Category Theory (ACT) workshop/school. I'm writing to see if
you'd be interested in being a mentor for the 2019 school. Mind, I'm
not seeking commitments or offering any certainties at this point.
I'm only writing to gauge your interest. Personally, I really loved
your work on lenses and think you'd be a really great addition.

Perhaps you got the idea of how the school works while at ACT2018, but
here's a few details.  How the school works is, essentially, you would
pick out a project that you're interested in working on that applies
category theory to some non-pure math field. What caught my interest
is your work on lenses and databases.  I think they'd be a great
addition to the ACT2019 school. Ultimately though, what project you'd
like to bring to the table is fully your decision.

Hi Taichi,

This is Daniel Cicala. I'm currently organizing the second iteration
of the Applied Category Theory (ACT) workshop/school. I'm writing to
see if you'd be interested in being a mentor for the 2019
school. Mind, I'm not seeking commitments or offering any certainties.
I'm only writing to gauge potential interest. Anyway, I think you'd be
a really great addition.

How the school works is, essentially, you would
pick out a project that you're interested in working on that applies
category theory to some non-pure math field. What caught my interest
is your `Theory of interface' paper.  Including biological networks is
very much in line with the sort of topics we'd like to include in the ACT2019 school. 

You'd be paired with about 4 grad students split into two pairs.
You'd assign to each pair a reading that you think is requisite
background for your project.  They'd present their paper to the entire

Hi Spencer,

This is Daniel Cicala. We met in Leiden at the ACT2018 workshop.  I'm
currently organizing the second iteration of the Applied Category
Theory (ACT) workshop/school. I'm writing to see if you'd be
interested in being a mentor for the 2019 school. Mind, I'm not
seeking commitments or offering any certainties at this point.  I'm
only writing to gauge your interest. Personally, I think you'd be a
really great addition.

Perhaps you grasped some of how the school works while at ACT2018, but
here are a few extra details. Essentially, you would pick out a
project that you're interested in working on that applies category
theory to some non-pure math field. Given that you work squarely in
industry applying category theory to real world problems, any project
in this realm is exactly what we'd like to include in the ACT2019
school. As to what specific project you'd like to bring to the table,
it is completely up to you.

You'd be paired with about 4 grad students split into two pairs.
You'd assign to each pair a reading that you think is requisite
background for your project.  They'd present their paper to the entire
group of students via video conference and write a blog post on the
