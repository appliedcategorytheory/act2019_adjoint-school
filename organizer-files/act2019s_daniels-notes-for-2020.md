# Suggestions for ACT2020 organizers

## My personal observations

* Do the group photo at the beginning of the in-person
  week. People leave midway thorugh the week. Maybe have it
  just after the very first orientation meeting to get it ot
  of the way.

* No more than 5 groups. 6 was definitely too many.

* Ensure diversity wrt gender, ethnicity, sexual
  orientation, and field of expertise (esp. for the mentors)

* Definitely use ta's and have them selected by the
  mentor. Suggest to the mentor to consider diversity when
  making their pick.

* Seek funding as far in advance as possible

* For the online portion, set up a fixed meeting time at the
  onset. Do not use weekly polls to set times.

* Be *very* clear when recruiting participation in
  advertisements or whatever that industry participation is
  welcome and encouraged

* Definitely invite Michael Johnson. Please ask me to
  justify this.

* When selecting the participants, the organizers should
  create a shortlist by themselves *then* ask the mentors for
  their input. The more active voices there are, the slower
  the decision process becomes.

* Try to create an application process, say through google
  forms, that will feed you a single file per applicant.  No
  matter how clearly you specify format requirements, people
  will not follow your directions and will give you a
  handful of files with all sorts of naming conventions. The
  only exception to this is for a letter of recommendation,
  which should be hidden from the applicant.

* Each group should have complementary backgrounds. We want
  people from different background expertise to interact
  with each other.

* Mix up locations for students, not too many from a single
  place, e.g. we had too many from Oxford in 2019. Part of
  the reason for that was likely self-selection: given that
  we didn't have funding only participants who were
  sufficiently local could commit to coming.

* When selecting students, weigh an average applicant who
  seems invested in pursuing ACT in the future over an
  excellent applicant who seems like this

* Motivation: get results AND build community (which
  involves getting students before they start their pdh
  research)

* Use a private github. Some people have the impulse to make
  the reading forum public.  Don't give in. Keep it private.
  Everyone should feel safe to ask "dumb and naive"
  questions and propose "dumb and naive" ideas without
  them living on in perpituity.

* Possible tutors: anne preller (linguistics), 

## NSF Grant proposal response

### Brendan Fong's response to NSF response

* Emphasising this program is now in its 3rd year, following
two highly successful programs (we can link to videos and to
publications, cite application statistics (126 applicants
this year))

* A very clear statement of what we consider to be diversity
  and equity in our community

* A precise recruitment strategy to address this

* Some historical statistics about participant selection
  (proportion of women, racial minorities, country of
  origin, universities, esp. within US)

* Talk more about fostering the community as a whole,
  eg. the way the school functions as an introduction to
  community at the ACT Conference, and how research projects
  will be presented at a special session of the conference

* State measurable outcomes and evaluation of success
  regarding the intellectual merits of the proposal.
  
* Emphasise importance of in person component (also
  emphasise that it will be in the US this year)

* Say we'll put the videos on YouTube

* Say childcare funding is potentially available to all participants, not just senior researchers

* Consider submitting to the Meetings and Conferences
  solicitation.

### Daniel's response to NSF response vis a vis 'scalability'

We should discuss how we have been doing the following
and/or how we will be doing the following.

* How does the Adjoint School help to grow the ACT
  community?

* What actions are we taking to ensure the sustainability of
  the ACT School? How are we building research
  infrastructure with this School? That is, are we forming
  partnerships between students, researchers, institutions?

* How can we ensure that collaborations continue after the
  school is finished for the year?

* Are there some metrics (qualitative or quantitative) we
  can use to convince the funders we are considering
  sustainability and we are impacting the broader research
  community? For example, we can build Slack channels of
  monthly video conferences (like the HoTT community is
  doing). We can track participation in related conferences
  like ACT, CT, SYCO. Track papers/preprints writting and
  collaborations on those.

* Internal promotion structure. Let ACT School students take
  on organizer or TA roles in the following year.
  Particularly for talented students who we'd like to keep
  in the ACT community.

* Seek other committed funding sources.

### Daniel's response to the NSF response vis a vis diversity

* During applicant selection, the first step is to sort the
  applicants into two categories: (1) applicant X can
  positively contribute to the ACT School mission and
  participating in the ACT School can positively contribute
  to the career of X, (2) else.  Reserve n% of spots for
  candidates from underrepp'ed background and fill those
  with the top candidates from underrep'd population who've
  made it into category (1). If there are more reserved
  spots than candidates from underrep'd populations in
  category (1), then fill the reserved spots as much as
  possible then release the remaining spots to the broader
  population. 
  
* Advertise the School with AWM and other similar
  organizations and say we are going to do this in the grant
  proposal. 
  
* Ask those in the ACT community to explicitly advertise to
  potential applicants they know that are from underrepp'd
  populations.
  
* Earmark something like $500 in our grant proposal for a
  Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) consultant. We can buy a
  few hours of time to get ideas on how to best approach DEI

* In next years NSF proposal, explicitly state *how* we are
  addressing the NSF feedback from the past year. Funders
  love this stuff apparently.
  
* If we can automate the application process, see if we can
  collect diversity related statistics like job applications
  do.  Of course, to do this, we would need to *only*
  collect the aggregate data so that individual applicant's
  answers are annonymous.  

* Whatever actions we take, explicitly state it in the grant
  proposal.
