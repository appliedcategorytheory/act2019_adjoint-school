John Baez on ACT research school workload (lightly edited for length
and clarity):

Apart from choosing two papers, I didn't have any responsibilities
during the time when the students read papers, gave presentations, and
blogged. I volunteered to attend the two videoconferences for the
presentations of the papers that I'd chosen, but only managed to
attend one of them. That took 1.5 hours.

The first work was choosing a research topic for the students on my
team. I created a list of about six topics and asked the students to
choose one or add their own.  We met once to discuss this before the Leiden meeting. This took about 3 hours.  

The hardest work occurred during and especially after meeting in Leiden.  We are now writing a paper on our research, and this is taking a lot of time, as papers always do -- no better and no worse than usual.  We're not done!

As far as the work load is concerned, the real question is whether one
wants to write a paper with four smart people who aren't experts in
what you're doing.
