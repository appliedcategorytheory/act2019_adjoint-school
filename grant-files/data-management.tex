\centerline{\large DATA MANAGEMENT PLAN}
\title{Applied Category Theory 2019}
\author{John C.\ Baez}

\maketitle

The main creative output of the work to take place under this grant
will be articles summarizing research papers to be published
online at the $n$-Category Caf\'e, videos of lectures from the workshop
made available at Oxford Quantum Videos and at the conference website,
and also journal publications.  All journal publications will be placed on
the the arXiv.

Other outputs include a more robust applied category theory
community.  Specifics include the forging of channels of communication between junior
and senior researchers as well as between researchers in previously
distinct fields.  

There are no anticipated primary data, samples, physical collections,
or other supporting materials to be created or gathered in the course
of work under this grant.

No development of software is expected to occur under this grant.
